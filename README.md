# Predicting-lenght-of-stay-in-hospitals

This project aims to predict the Length of Stay (LoS) of patients in hospitals using Linear Regression.
It is an example of when NOT to to use linear regression while selecting what algorithm to use for your machine learning problem.

This project can help hospitals in several ways. By predicting the length of stay of patients, hospitals can better plan and allocate their resources, reduce overall costs, and improve patient care. For instance, hospitals can use the predictions to optimize bed management, staffing, and discharge planning. Additionally, the predictions can help identify patients who are at risk of prolonged hospitalization and take proactive measures to prevent complications and readmissions.
Moreover, this project can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence the length of stay of patients. By analysing the relationships between the features and the target variable, students can identify the most important predictors and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This knowledge can be used to develop more effective interventions and treatments that can reduce the length of stay and improve patient outcomes.

Project Description
The dataset used for this project is the Healthcare.Blueprint-Predicting Length of Stay in Hospitals dataset, which contains 25 columns including rcount, gender, dialysisrenalendstage, asthma, irondef, pneum, substancedependence, psychologicaldisordermajor, depress, psychother, fibrosisandother, malnutrition, hemo, hematocrit, neutrophils, sodium, glucose, bloodureanitro, creatinine, bmi, pulse, respiration, secondarydiagnosisnonicd9, lengthofstay, and number_of_issues. The goal is to predict the length of stay of patients based on these features.
Project tasks:
1.	Load the data from the file: Healthcare.Blueprint-Predicting Length of Stay in Hospitals.
2.	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data, identify patterns, trends, and detect outliers.
3.	Clean missing data (if there are) by either removing the rows with missing data or imputing the missing values.
4.	Deal with outliers
5.	Remove columns which are not significant for the model.
6.	Preprocess the data by scaling the features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
7.	Train a Linear Regression model on the training set.
8.	Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set using R-squared.
9.	Finally, use the trained model to predict the length of stay of new patients.
